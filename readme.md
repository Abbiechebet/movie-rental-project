 >>>Your first task is to create a service for managing the list of genres
 
 >>>We should have an endpoint for getting the list of all genres because somewhere in our client application is perhaps we have a drop down list where the user to select a genre. So we need an endpoint to get all the genres.
 
 >>> We should also be able to create a new genre as well as update or delete an existing one.
