 back end services for Vid application.

Vid is an imaginary service for renting out movies

 >>>Your first task is to create a service for managing the list of genres
 
 >>>We should have an endpoint for getting the list of all genres because somewhere in our client application is perhaps we have a drop down list where the user to select a genre. So we need an endpoint to get all the genres.
 
 >>> We should also be able to create a new genre as well as update or delete an existing one.


So before going any further, I want you to put what you have learned so far in practice So go ahead, start a new project from scratch, call it vid and build this HTTP service for managing the list of genres. 

>>>Deliverables (github repo): send github repo for this Vid Project (movie rental project)
